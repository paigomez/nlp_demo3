# NLP example project 3 (Movie Recommender)

This project demonstrates how to use spaCy to recommend a movie by using the en_core_web_md language model to compare similarities between their descriptions. It reads in descriptions from a file containing a list of movies, then compares them to a sample movie definition, and returns the most similar movie

### How to use:
* Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Install language model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_md`
* Run program: `python watch_next.py`

### Credits
This was developed by Patricia Gomez, as part of the Hyperion Dev bootcamp
